# Sprint 7 project

# The purpose of the project is to test API calls while using Jest to do automated testing and to see if the functionality is following the project’s written requirements. 8 files were created to test the status response and check if the response body contains the expected data.  

# The technologies used to make the testing are by using VS code IDE to write Javascript code and using the “Jest” framework. The techniques used in the code are by utilizing looping to grab pieces of information that were contained in objects. The objects were stored in arrays to be called later. Also, we used the object by itself for selecting a specific value that was compared in the test.  We use that data by using the expected method and Jest matches to compare the expected and actual results.  

# Instructions to run all tests
