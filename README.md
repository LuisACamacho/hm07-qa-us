# Sprint 7 project

# The purpose of the project is to test API calls while using Jest to do automated testing and to see if the functionality is following the project’s written requirements. 8 files were created to test the status response and check if the response body contains the expected data.  

# The technologies used for the tests is by utilziing VS code IDE to write Javascript code and using the “Jest” framework. One of the techniques in the code was using loops to grab pieces of information that were contained in objects. Thereafter, the objects were stored in arrays to be called later. When comparing the results, I used correct predefined data as the expected result  and used the existsing array with the Actual results. All the tests utilized the Jest matches to be able to compare the results.

# Instructions to run all tests 
# ------------------------------
# 1.  Generate "Urban Grocers" server and add URL to config.js
# 2.  Open the terminal 
# 3.  Go to the project path      Commnad: cd hm07-qa-us  
# 4.  Run the jest command        Command: npx jest
